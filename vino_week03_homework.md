**Process:**
Base on the schematic I hook up the circuit. But I failed for many times.

Then I check the documents about how a transistor work.
Here are what I learnt:
The whole circuit can be regard as a water flow system. The base is like a valve. Generally the channel between E to C is closed. We need to push the valve(B) to open the channel. 
So we need to connected the B to the voltage. And the working voltage of the Base is about 0.6V and the working current is about 10-100mA so that’s way we need to connect a 10KΩ to protect the transistor.
One issue still remain was:
The different usage of the PNP and NPN.
It seems looks like just their polarity are contrary. The schematics below are demonstrate the usage of the pull-up and pull-down method.
But I can’t recognize when should I use a pull-up and when should be another one.
